    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey! My name is Amber v/d Reijden and I'm currently 22 years old. Before I started the study FDND, I did the course Mediatechnology at Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam.
      This is where I have learned HTML, CSS & Javascript basics.
    </p>

    <h2>Why FDND?</h2>
    <p>
      I've always liked designing and developing websites at my previous study, I wasn't a fan of backend. When I was googling and found out there was a Frontend Design & Development study, I decided to give it a shot!
    </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a very active person, so you can always find me at the gym or at Beest Boulders. 
      When I'm relaxing, I like to read, watch crime documentaries or practice my photography.
    </p>
